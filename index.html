                <p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming
                    language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is
                    also
                    available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on
                    Python
                    programming language</p>

                <ul id="feature">
                    <li><b>Python is Interpreted</b> ‚àí Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not
                        need to
                        compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
                    <li><b>Python is Interactive</b> ‚àí You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the
                        interpreter
                        directly to write your programs.</li>
                    <li><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> ‚àí Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of

            <section class="main-secction" id="hello_world">
                <header>Hello World</header>
                <p>A simple program that displays ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù. It's often used to illustrate the syntax of the
                    language.
                </p>
                <code>
                # This program prints Hello, world!<br>

                print('Hello, world!')
            </code>
                <p>In this program, we have used the built-in print() function to print the string Hello, world! on our
                    screen. <br><br>

                    By the way, a string is a sequence of characters. In Python, strings are enclosed inside single
                    quotes,
                    double quotes, or triple quotes.</p>

            <section class="main-secction" id="variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create
                    a
                    variable you reserve some space in memory.

                    Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be
                    stored in
                    the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store
                    integers,
                    decimals or characters in these variables.</p>

            <section class="main-secction" id="data_types">
                <header>Data Types</header>
                <p>Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types
                    are
                    actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes. <br><br>

                    There are various data types in Python. Some of the important types are listed below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Numbers</b><br>
                        <p>Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to
                            them. For example ‚àí</p>
                        <code>
                        var1 = 1<br>
                        var2 = 10<br><br>
                    </code>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Strings</b><br>
                        <p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the
                            quotation
                            marks. Python allows for either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be
                            taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of
                            the
                            string and working their way from -1 at the end.
                            <br><br>
                            The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the
                            repetition
                            operator. For example ‚àí</p>
                        <code>
                        str = 'Hello World!'<br><br>

                        print str          # Prints complete string<br>
                        print str[0]       # Prints first character of the string<br>
                        print str[2:5]     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th<br>
                        print str[2:]      # Prints string starting from 3rd character<br>
                        print str * 2      # Prints string two times<br>
                        print str + "TEST" # Prints concatenated string<br><br>
                    </code>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Lists</b>
                        <p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated
                            by
                            commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays
                            in
                            C. One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different
                            data type.</p>
                        <p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with
                            indexes
                            starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (+)
                            sign is
                            the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. <br> For
                            example ‚àí
                        </p>
                        <code>
                        list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]<br>
                        tinylist = [123, 'john']<br><br>

                        print list          # Prints complete list<br>
                        print list[0]       # Prints first element of the list<br>
                        print list[1:3]     # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd<br> 
                        print list[2:]      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element<br>
                        print tinylist * 2  # Prints list two times<br>
                        print list + tinylist # Prints concatenated lists<br><br>
                    </code>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Tuples</b>
                        <p>A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a
                            number
                            of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within
                            parentheses.
                        </p>
                        <p>The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and
                            their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and
                            cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.<br> For example ‚àí</p>
                        <code>
                        tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )<br>
                        tinytuple = (123, 'john')<br><br>

                        print tuple               # Prints the complete tuple<br>
                        print tuple[0]            # Prints first element of the tuple<br>
                        print tuple[1:3]          # Prints elements of the tuple starting from 2nd till 3rd<br> 
                        print tuple[2:]           # Prints elements of the tuple starting from 3rd element<br>
                        print tinytuple * 2       # Prints the contents of the tuple twice<br>
                        print tuple + tinytuple   # Prints concatenated tuples<br><br>
                    </code>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Dictionary</b>
                        <p>Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type. They work like associative arrays or
                            hashes
                            found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python
                            type,
                            but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python
                            object.</p>
                        <p>Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using
                            square braces ([]).<br> For example ‚àí</p>
                        <code>

                            dict = {}<br>
                            dict['one'] = "This is one"<br>
                            dict[2]     = "This is two"<br><br>

                            tinydict = {'name': 'john','code':6734, 'dept': 'sales'}<br><br>


                            print dict['one']       # Prints value for 'one' key<br>
                            print dict[2]           # Prints value for 2 key<br>
                            print tinydict          # Prints complete dictionary<br>
                            print tinydict.keys()   # Prints all the keys<br>
                            print tinydict.values() # Prints all the values<br><br>
                        </code>
                    </li>

                    <p>Dictionaries have no concept of order among elements. It is incorrect to say that the elements
                        are
                        "out of order"; they are simply unordered.</p>

                <header>Control Flow</header>
                <p>Control flow is the order in which the program's code executes. The control flow of a Python program
                    is
                    regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls. This section covers the if statement
                    and
                    for and while loops; functions are covered later in this chapter.</p>

                        <p> Decision Making in programming is needed to make the logical decision for doing some
                            operations.
                            In ES6, decision making can be made using the following conditional statements:<br><br>

                        <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated
                            execution paths.

                            A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>for loop</b></li>
                            <p>If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in
                                the
                                sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var. Next, the statements block
                                is
                                executed. Each item in the list is assigned to iterating_var, and the statement(s) block
                                is
                                executed until the entire sequence is exhausted.</p>

                                <b>while Loop</b>
                                <p>In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a
                                    programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python
                                    uses
                                    indentation as its method of grouping statements.

                                </p>
                                <code>
                                count = 0<br>
                                while (count < 9):<br>
                                print 'The count is:', count<br>
                                count = count + 1<br><br>

                            <li><b>nested Loop</b></li>
                            <p>Python programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop. Following section
                                shows few examples to illustrate the concept. A final note on loop nesting is that you
                                can
                                put any type of loop inside of any other type of loop. For example a for loop can be
                                inside
                                a while loop or vice versa.</p>

                                j = 2<br>
                                while(j <= (i/j)):<br>
                                    if not(i%j): break<br>
